## Goal For This Project

Welcome from Petiole!

## UX

An important aspect of the planning for this project was the element of User-Experience. 
Directing the planning of the project through a User-Experience approach created a useful 
guide to understand the user's needs and streamline the development of the site. Through 
visiting Petiole, it was important to create a positive user experience.

### wireframes

- [Wireframes](): A plant directory and social plant site.

The initial wireframes and the current project differ in some minor ways:

- ...

### Design Choices

- I attempted to create a website that felt light, fun and not too rigid.
- The colour choices were centered around [colorspace](https://mycolor.space/) to 
find the complementary colour palettes that worked well.

### Fonts

- The goal was an overall cohesive feeling to the website so I decided not to use multiple fonts.
- I wanted something contemporary but also clean & clear. 
- The font was chosen from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to make sure it worked across browsers/devices.

### Icons

- The site doesn't include too many icons to create a user-friendly experience and is familiar to the user.
- Users are very familiar with the social media icons and the main navigational icons, which is why those were the only ones used.
- The icons made the content more concise and didn't distract from the information.
- The icon seen most is the hamburger icon that will make navigation more simple on mobile devices.

### Colours

- The colour theme included four main colours that complimented one another.
- The colours were chosen because of their contrast and the way they can be associated with plants.

## Features

- Responsive on all device sizes
  - Including a change in layout across different breakpoints.
- Interactive elements
  - Including: buttons, links, dropdown menus, and forms.

### Navigation

- The navigation bar was created using Bootstrap to ensure that it was fully responsive.
- An example of the change with responsiveness includes a hamburger menu when viewed on smaller viewports.

### Cards

- There are multiple cards across the site to include snapshots of information that users require.
- They are clear with crisp imagery and include information & links to the relevant sections.

### Signup

- Ability for users to give information in a structured form with validations so that information isn't incomplete.

### Search
- Ability to search for specific plants

### Navigation bar

1. Plan

   - On every page, every link should take you to where you are supposed to go
   - On mobile devices the navbar should turn to hamburger so it's visible and the drop-down menu should appear so navigational elements can be chosen

2. Implementation

   - The navbar was created using Bootstrap so that it was fully responsive
   - In the mobile implementation the Popfit header is hidden as a link

3. Test

   - Clicked on every link on every page & checked every page on different breakpoints to ensure responsiveness
